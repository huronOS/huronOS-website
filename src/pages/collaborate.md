# Collaborate with the team!
Whether you are experienced or new into unix-like systems, you can contribute in several ways to the huronOS project.
Building the system, debug and report issues, testing features and testing quality are time consuming tasks on this project.
Developers will feel grateful with any collaboration you want to contribute with.

### Use huronOS, send feedback!
One of the best ways to help improve huronOS is using it!, Either for personal use or for training contests in your local community, real life use is the best way to find feedback. Reach out with your feedback to `equetzal [at] huronos.org`

### Report issues
If you notice that something's wrong, please report the issue at the `huronOS-build-tools` repository via Github. If you prefer not to use Github, please send a mail to `equetzal [at] huronos.org`.

### Spread the word!
If you've already used huronOS or knows a community which huronOS might be a good fit for them, spread the word!, The more people to switch to huronOS the less effort each community needs to take on their own, and collaboration from multiple communities to this project will also help improve the system for everyone.

## Become a dev!
**Interested in developing for the project?**, you are very welcome to do it!
We don't have a formal onboarding plan, but in the docs there's a lot of useful information about the system that will likely help you to later understand the codebase the best.

Even without the formal onboarding, we do recommend you following the this path:
1. **Learn how to use huronOS**  
    This is very important, there's crucial for devs to understand **what are we doing**, **why are we doing it** and **how are we doing it**. This also ensure that we are aligned to the purpose of this project, and to focus our ideas on how to better improve it. Make sure to test the distro, create a contest, configure a directives file and sync at least two instances.
2. **Read about the internals**  
    The internals documentation talks more about in-depth design decisions for building huronOS. This is also very important because this is totally related to the code and it's implementation.
3. **Get familiar with the codebase**  
    You'll likely relate the internals designs and architecture with the codebase, so it is better for you to if you start getting involved with the basic codebase such as the system layers and the software modules.
4. **Create a build**  
    Go ahead and read the [how to create a build](/docs/development/how-to-create-a-build.md) doc and create your own build. Make sure to checkout a build tag to make sure you're not dealing with buggy code. This will let you know the process for creating a build and packing it for distributing it.
5. **Read the development standards**  
    We do have standards for the codebase, this ensure everyone to be aligned to certain tooling and to skip useless discussions about e.g. code formatting preferences. 
6. **Start developing!**  
    Reach out to the team either via discord or email to `equetzal [at] huronos.org` and integrate to the team, we all be happy to meet you, help you with any questions, give you some introductory task and talk about our current issues, milestones and planned features.
