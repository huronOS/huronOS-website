# Who's Supporting Us?

huronOS is a free, open-source software project designed to assist educational institutions and individuals in competitive programming competitions. As a non-commercial initiative, huronOS generates no revenue. However, contributions from our supporters are vital in keeping the project operational and active.

The National Polytechnic Institute (Instituto Politécnico Nacional - IPN) is a Mexican university with a strong emphasis on engineering, mathematics, and science. IPN supports huronOS by providing essential infrastructure, including servers for hosting critical services such as our ISO mirror storage system, apt mirror, build systems, a gigabit network connection, and NTP servers.

### Advanced Multi-layered Union File System (AUFS)
Junjiro Okajima (岡島​順治郎), the primary maintainer of the Advanced Multi-layered Union File System (AUFS), has been a significant supporter of the huronOS project. His continued maintenance of the main filesystem used by huronOS is invaluable to our ongoing development.
